# Deserters

TFP does not tolerate desertion during defensive wars.  Those who desert will suffer various penalties, as described in this
document.

## Penalties for Desertion

### A. Immediate Penalties

The following penalties will be immediately applied to any member who deserts TFP:

1. An embargo from the TFP alliance with the following reason:  "Deserted TFP during a defensive war".

### B. Post-War Penalties

The following penalties will be applied after the war to any member who deserted TFP during said war:

1. Any deserter who has not yet found a new alliance will be hunted down and destroyed in a single three-attacker attrition war.

    1. The reason given by the attackers for this war should be:  "Punitive war against alliance deserter".

1. Any deserter who has found a new alliance will only be hunted down if their alliance will permit us to do so.  If not, such
  deserters will either:
  
    1. Have a bounty placed upon them; or if this is not desirable,
    
    1. Be permanently embargoed by TFP.
  
        1. If meeting the conditions for a permanent embargo, the current embargo should be ended, and a new embargo with the
           following description should be declared:  "Deserted TFP during a defensive war (permanent embargo)".

1. Unless the deserter in-question is under an embargo for different reasons, the embargo against them is to end once they meet
  all of the following conditions:
  
    1. All outstanding debts to TFP have been repaid to TFP.
    
    1. They are not actively embargoing TFP.
    
    1. One of the following is true:
    
        1. They have lost a punitive war for deserting against TFP.
    
        1. A bounty has been placed upon them.
